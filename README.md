This is a repository containing a demonstration project for SOA Suite 12.1.3, running on
Oracle's OTN Virtual Box image for SOA Suite 12cR1.
The project demonstrates how to invoke REST APIs protected by OAuth 2.0, the example being the 
Google Task API.
It uses the REST adapter for the interaction with Google and the Coherence adapter for the caching
of the credentials (access and refresh tokens).
